// For this assignment your team should produce a functional testing document.   After introductory material (descriptions of the product to be tested and the testing environment, a record of changes, special considerations. etc.), the bulk of the document should consist of functional test case descriptions based on requirements in your SRS.  Your document can be modeled on any of the example testing documents or formats posted on Canvas.  It will be graded on its completeness, clarity, organization, and "professional" appearance.  (If you choose to use the tabular format in the Test-Cases-for-OrangeHRM (Excel) document, you will need to add introductory material.)
