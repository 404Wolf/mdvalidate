# Markdown Schema

**Very early stage work in progress!!**

MDS is a **tiny language for describing how Markdown *should look***. With
`mdvalidate`, you write *schemas* that define a shape of Markdown, and MDS
checks real documents against them.

It's designed for validating a stream of Markdown via stdin, so you can pipe
input (like LLM output) and validate the shape of its response.

`mdvalidate` schemas consist of many "matcher" patterns, and all matchers have
labels. This means that all validated markdown files can produce a JSON of
matches found along the way.

We plan to eventually support converting a Markdown schema into a JSON schema
describing the shape of the output that it produces once it has validated some
Markdown file.

`mdvalidate` is written in 100% safe rust and is ðŸ”¥ blazingly fast ðŸ”¥.

## âœ¨ Some examples of what you can match 

- **Literal Matching:** Regular Markdown stays literal â€” if it says `# Title`,
  it must match exactly.
- **Matchers:** Use `` `label:/regex/` `` to define rules for dynamic content.
- **Optional or Repeated Items:** Add `?` for optional things, `+` for one or
  more.
- **Lists & Sublists:** Validate nested lists with pattern control.
- **Escaping:** Add `!` to disable regex interpretation â€” great for examples.

## Mini Example

Hereâ€™s a simple schema that will validate all grocery lists of a specific shape.


```markdown
# Grocery List

- `item:/[A-Z][a-z]+/`+         <!-- one or more items; each starts with a capital letter -->
  - `note:/\w+/`?{,2}           <!-- up to two optional sub-notes per item -->

A passing document:

```markdown
# Grocery List

- Apples
  - organic
  - local
- Bananas
  - ripe
```

A failing document (too many sub-notes):

```markdown
# Grocery List

- Apples
  - organic
  - local
  - green
```
